## find-and-replace

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that substituting fixed strings with sed, which only offers regex substitution, is a massive pain. There are also some cases in which one would want to replace strings that spread across multiple lines, hence the creation of this tool, which, unlike sed, defaults to, not regular expressions, but fixed strings, though still supporting the former when a certain flag is enabled, and does substitution, not line by line as does sed, but on the whole file, each file being interpreted as a single string. The tool also supports recursing on the provided directories, with the ability to include and exclude certain files with glob matching.
